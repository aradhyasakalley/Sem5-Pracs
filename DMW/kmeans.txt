Kmeans algorithm
input : 
set of elements D = {t1,t2,t3,......tn}
k : number of clusters
output : 
K : set of clusters

Kmeams algorithm : 
    assing initial values to means m1,m2,....mk;
    repeat : 
        assign the item to the cluster with the closest mean;
        re-calculate the means for each cluster;
    until convergence
