DTBuild algo

input : training data
output : decision tree

T = 0 
determine; the best splitting criterion;
T = create the root node and label with splitting attribute;
T = add arc to the root node for each predicate value and label;
for each arc do : 
    D = database formed by applying splitting predicate to D;
    if stopping point is reached for this path : 
        T' = create leaf node and label appropriate class;
    else :

DTProc algo
input : training data and decision tree
output : model predicted values

DTProc algo : 
    for each t E D do : 
    n = root node of T;
    while n not leaf node do : 
        obtain answer for question on n applied to t;
        identify the arc from t with correct answer;
        n = node at end of this arc;
    make predictions for t based on lbelling of n
